  <h1>StephenOrr.co.uk</h1>

  <p>
    I'm in the process of rebuilding this site. There'll be
    more to see soon.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime, you can find me on Twitter (@StephenOrr1981) or GitHub (stephenorr).

  <h2>My Projects</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3><a href="/projects/unity/space_shooter/">Space Shooter</a></h3>
      <p>
        The Unity sample project. I was really impressed with how clear the tutorial was, and how powerful the system is in general.
        I didn't expect lots of dragging and dropping to be a realistic way of building a game, but it seems to work!

      <ul class="tools">
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Unity</li>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/stephenorr/putty_themer">PuTTY Themer</a></h3>
      <p>
        A very simple command-line tool to apply a colour scheme and font to all PuTTY sessions saved in the user's registry.
        I built this about 3 years ago, and I was pleased to find that it still works under current versions of Windows and Ruby.
        I haven't been able to find a similar tool that does the job better (do people just not care about this stuff on Windows?),
        but do please let me know if you do find something.
