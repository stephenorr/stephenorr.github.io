Hi. I'm Steve Hill.

I'm a technology enthusiast and developer from the UK.

I've worked with more technologies than I care to remember; for the majority of
my career I've worked with PHP, but I'm also comfortable with Ruby, Golang and
Python.

Far from being just a developer, I'm also familiar with the operations side; I've
written provisioning scripts in Bash and Ansible, and I'm currently experimenting
with containerisation technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.

I also occasionally dabble with games development, which has been an interest of
mine since I was a young child. Growing up in the 80s, I was exposed to early
computers such as the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64, and later the Commodore
Amiga; I blame this early exposure for getting me interested in programming, and
I still enjoy playing the old games as well.

I read a lot; my bookshelves are crammed with hundreds of books spanning a multitude
of genres. I won't pretend to have read everything I own - there are only so many
hours in the day, after all - but if I ever did, I suspect the universe might turn
inside out.

I have a keen interest in space travel, and I'd love to be able to set foot on Mars
one day (I'd settle for the Moon though). Maybe that will be possible within my
lifetime...
