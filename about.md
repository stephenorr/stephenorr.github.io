Hi. I'm Steve Hill.

I'm currently working as a senior developer for Siftware. We're a small team of
PHP website and application maintenance experts, focusing on ensuring that the
investment organisations have made in their systems continue to deliver business
value.

When I'm not working with PHP, I'm working with Ruby, or hacking on game ideas,
or playing games from various eras from the 80s up to modern day. I also enjoy
reading books, listening to music and I maintain a keen interest in world events
and history, science fiction, space travel and technology. In short, a little
bit of everything.
