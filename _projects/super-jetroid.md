A simple game, created by following Jesse Freeman's Unity tutorial on Lynda.com. This
is the first full tutorial I've seen that produces something that might actually be
fun to play for an extended period - although there's only one level here, and the
default air supply is so tight I don't believe anyone could complete that :)

You can download the Windows and Mac builds here too, as well as playing the game
online with the Unity Web Player.
