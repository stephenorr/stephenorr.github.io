A very simple command-line tool to apply a colour scheme and font to all PuTTY sessions
saved in the user's registry. I built this about 3 years ago, and I was pleased to find
that it still works under current versions of Windows and Ruby. I haven't been able to
find a similar tool that does the job better (do people just not care about this stuff
on Windows?), but do please let me know if you do find something.
