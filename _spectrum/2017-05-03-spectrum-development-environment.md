Excited by meeting Henrique Olifiers and Jim Bagley at last year's Revival 2016,
I was all set to start on developing a game for the upcoming Spectrum Next.

It's taken them slightly longer than expected to launch the Kickstarter for this
absolutely stunning looking machine; tweaks to the spec being the main reason
for the delay. The team are super passionate about delivering something that
really captures the essence of the Spectrum, while bringing it up-to-date with
new abilities that it could never have had back in the day.

That Kickstarter is already well over its initial goal; as I write this, it's
sitting at £427,829 - the target amount was £250,000. It's looking likely that
it'll meet at least the next stretch goal at £450,000 by the end of this week,
and hopefully then blast on to meet the others.

All this has gotten me excited about Spectrum development again, and so I'm
looking at setting up a development environment to make it easier for me to do
so. Bear in mind that I was a kid when I had my Spectrum back in the 80s and
early 90s, so any programming I did was fairly limited. I barely touched machine
code, although I did experiment a little with a cool package called White
Lightning (not the cider - it was a version of FORTH intended specifically for
games programming).

I'll update this post to contain information on my progress...
